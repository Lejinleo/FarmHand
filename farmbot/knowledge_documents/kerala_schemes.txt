The Kerala government, through the Krishi Bhavan, offers several schemes to support farmers. The Kerala Karshaka Kshemanidhi Board (Farmer's Welfare Fund Board) provides a monthly pension to registered farmers over the age of 60. To be eligible, a farmer must make a small monthly contribution. The board also offers financial aid for medical emergencies and the education of farmers' children. Additionally, there are state-level subsidies available for purchasing high-quality seeds, organic fertilizers, and modern farming equipment. Farmers should contact their local Krishi Bhavan for detailed information on eligibility and the application process for these schemes. The central PM-KISAN scheme is also available.
