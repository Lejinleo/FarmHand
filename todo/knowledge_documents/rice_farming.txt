The Mundakan rice cultivation season in Kerala begins from September-October, coinciding with the Thulavarsham or Northeast Monsoon. Proper field preparation is crucial. The field must be ploughed thoroughly and have excellent drainage to prevent waterlogging from heavy rains. High-yielding rice varieties suitable for this season include 'Uma', 'Jyothy', and 'Jaya'. Seedlings should be transplanted when they are about 20-25 days old for optimal growth. For nutrient management, a basal dose of farmyard manure, often called 'adipoli', should be applied. Chemical fertilizers like NPK should be used based on soil test results to ensure balanced nutrition and a healthy crop.
