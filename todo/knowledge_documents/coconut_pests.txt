Coconut palms in Kerala are susceptible to several pests. The Rhinoceros beetle ('Komban chelli') is a major threat, as it bores into the tender fronds and damages the plant. Management includes using pheromone traps to capture adult beetles and applying a mix of sand and neem cake to the palm's crown. Another significant pest is the Red palm weevil ('Chenkomban'), whose grubs bore into the trunk, often killing the tree from the inside. Early detection is key. The root-wilt disease, locally known as 'Kaattu veezhcha', is a debilitating disease that causes yellowing of leaves and a general decline in the palm's health. There is no cure, but proper nutrient management and irrigation can help manage the symptoms and prolong the palm's life.
